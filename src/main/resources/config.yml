# DynamicShopGUI Configuration

# Dynamic Pricing System:
# Prices now change smoothly based on stock levels using a continuous formula.
# The system automatically adjusts for items with high max stock to prevent
# drastic price changes from small transactions.
#
# General price behavior:
# - Very low stock (0-10%): Prices increase significantly (up to 2.5x base price)
# - Low stock (10-50%): Prices gradually decrease from 2.0x to 1.15x
# - Medium stock (50-90%): Prices continue decreasing from 1.15x to 0.8x
# - High stock (90-100%): Prices reach minimum levels (down to 0.6x base price)
#
# For items with high max stock (>1000), price changes are automatically
# smoothed to prevent large jumps from single transactions.

# Price factors - momentum-based adjustments
price-factors:
  # These factors affect price momentum when items are bought/sold frequently
  increase: 0.05  # Additional price momentum when items are bought frequently
  decrease: 0.03  # Additional price momentum when items are sold frequently

price-limits:
  min-multiplier: 0.1   # Minimum price is 10% of base price
  max-multiplier: 10.0  # Maximum price is 10x base price
